# React Matching Game

### Creating a React Project w/ Vite

Obviously, this one is created for you, but for future reference:

1. Run ```pnpm create vite``` OR ```npx create vite@latest```
2. Select React for framework
3. Select TypeScript for variant
4. Select Yes/No for rolldown-vite (it's a bundler, so totally up to you)

## Matching Game Design

This design is very similar to the one from last week, we'll primarily be using the ```Tile``` interface to hold the game state.

First though, a file tree tour:

```
/week_three
|- node_modules/
|
|


```
